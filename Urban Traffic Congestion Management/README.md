# Analytical Dimensions

## Temporal Analysis:

Visualize traffic patterns throughout the day, week, and year
Track changes in congestion levels over multiple years

## Geospatial Aspects:

Map real-time traffic flow across the city
Visualize accident hotspots and their impact on surrounding areas

## Textual/Linguistic Data:

Analyze social media posts about traffic conditions
Visualize common complaints from citizen feedback channels

## Network Relationships:

Map the interconnectedness of major roads and intersections
Visualize public transportation routes and their effect on traffic

# Stakeholder Analysis
